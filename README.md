# Drupal 8 community video curriculum

This is an open-source curriculum on Drupal 8 for developers. The lessons will
be provided to the Drupal community as free videos and as a text tutorial.

## How to use the curriculum

The lessons are provided in order from basic to advanced topics, with later
lessons building on earlier ones. It's not required to go through the lessons
in order; for example, developers who are comfortable with object-oriented
programming (OOP) in PHP might choose to skip
[lesson 2](lessons/lesson_2/index.md) (below). The recommended background for
each lesson will be linked under "What should I know first?"
