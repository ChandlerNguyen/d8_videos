PHP version requirement
brief summary of key concepts: what is a class, interface, method
abstract classes and methods
static methods
public vs. protected (we don't use private)
namespaces and use statments

This should be exclusively about PHP language features, nothing Drupal other than stating the version requirement, so that people with an OO background can just skip it.
